How to configure the config.json properly and what each value means.

First head over to your profiles folder then FreezeMining/Mining Directory and open config.json

There are many values here that can be changed to your liking

        {
            "actionText": "Mine for Copper Ore",
            "max_mine": -1,
            "enabledTypes": [
                "FreezeNode_copper" = What node this value below is handling
            ],
            "itemsProbabilities": [
                {
                    "item": "Freezestone_copper", = What drops when mining
                    "probability": 50 = Percentage chance to drop per mine. 
                },
                {
                    "item": "Stone",
                    "probability": 50
                }
            ]
        }

CHange these values for each ones accordingly to how you want it to perform.

Then at the end of the file is this

"minedItemsProbabilities": {
        "Stone": 200,
        "SmallStone": 100, 
        "Freezestone_iron": 10,
        "Freezestone_tin": 10,
        "Freezestone_silver": 10,
        "Freezestone_gold": 15,
        "Freezestone_copper": 20,
        "Freezestone_uranium": 15,
        "Freezestone_sulphur": 5,
        "FreezeGem_Amber": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Amethyst": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Aquamrine": 15,
        "FreezeGem_FancyColourDiamond": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Iolite": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Jade": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Ruby": 15,
        "FreezeGem_Turquoise": 15
    }

This is the values that handle the VANILLA stones and rocks you can mine in game with the sledgehammer and pickaxe.

IN its default state this will allow you to mine the gems and stones from the vanilla rocks also with the specific probabilities above.
IF you do not want the gems and stones to be obtained set this file like so 
"minedItemsProbabilities": {
        "Stone": 200,
        "SmallStone": 100
	}

This configuration here will only allow the normal large and small stones to be mined from these rocks rather than it dropping the gems and stones.
