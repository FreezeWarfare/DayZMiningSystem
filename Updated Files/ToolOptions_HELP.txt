ToolOptions.json Help

All this dose it enables/disables tools that are ONLY for mining.
This is how it works: 1 = True | 0 = False
Example:
"Pickaxe": 1,  this allows the Pickaxe to work for mining the nodes/vanilla rocks.
"SplittingAxe": 0, this disables the Splitting Axe for mining nodes/vanilla rocks.
