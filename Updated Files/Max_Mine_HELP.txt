The max_mine setting in your config.json file determines the maximum number of times a rock node can be mined before it is removed. Here is a detailed explanation of how this setting works and its implications: ("max_mine": 6, is the limit)

max_mine Setting
Default Value (-1): When max_mine is set to -1, it implies there is no limit to the number of times a rock node can be mined. This is essentially an infinite mining setting.
Specific Value (e.g., 6): If max_mine is set to any positive integer, that value will be the maximum number of times a rock node can be mined. For example, if max_mine is set to 6, the node can only be mined six times before it is removed from the game.

Impact of Changing max_mine
Setting to 6: If you want to ensure that each rock node can only be mined six times, you should set max_mine to 6. This will enforce the six-hit limit.
Allowing Changes: If you allow users to change the max_mine value, they can set it to any positive integer to control the number of times a node can be mined. Setting it to -1 will allow unlimited mining.
