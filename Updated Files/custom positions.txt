If you would like to set up your own spawn positions for this mod I recommend using DayZ Editor - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2250764298

In this tool you can place all of the nodes accordingly and generate an eventpos.xml file to addon to your current ones or to make new ones. 
Its very versatile but can be confusing if you have never used it before. I will not be teaching you how to use it but will explain how to set it up.

Things you must do before running the editor is ENSURE you have the mining system mod loaded as well as dayz-editor. If you do not you can not
place the required nodes to your liking.

When you run the editor you can click play/start editor and choose your desired map. You can then search for the specific nodes you wish to place
And then place them within the editor. Once the nodes are all places you can then select all the objects and click file, export to eventspawns.xml 
Once exported it will give you the required positions: Note Either make your own events for them seperately or put them into the existing ItemNodeSpawn
setup in your cfgeventspawns.xml

I will give you some examples of how ive set up mine. 

In my cfgeventspawns.xml I have it like this 

https://i.imgur.com/Mea2zUL.png (Note I have more positions but this is just an example.) - Ive made my own event name so its organised and I know
Which nodes are in which positions rather than them all being randomized. But of course set it up how you wish.

Then in events.xml I have it like this - https://i.imgur.com/F9EQYmB.png

Here you can see i have them individually made instead of all thrown together in ONE file. Each node has multiple spawns but have only set a few to spawn 
so they are randomized each time. 

The editor can be a bit hard to use at first so google or youtube a guide on how to use it first before jumping straight in.
